## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Git Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/git).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/git:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/git/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/git:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
$ cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
$ docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest .
```

## Configuration

### Running commands

To run commands inside this container you can use `docker run`, for example to execute `git version` you can follow below example

```console
$ docker run --name git bitnami/git:latest git --version
```

## Notable Changes

### 2.31.0-debian-10-r2

- The `ENTRYPOINT` of the container has been modified to load a proper NSS environment that enables git ssh connections when running the container as non-root.
- The `CMD` is also changed to enter the Bash shell.

If you were using the container without replacing the entrypoint [`ENTRYPOINT [ "git" ]`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/git/blob/af46ea91cebed3de1a863cb9969210688131b4e9/2/debian-10/Dockerfile#L19), make sure you specify the `git` command now:

```diff
-docker run bitnami/git:latest --version
+docker run bitnami/git:latest git --version
```
